There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
'Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, <span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
<span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>
The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is, <span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
That this night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
<span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon
<span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>

Please don't have somebody waiting on you

<span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
'Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, <span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is, <span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again

Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
'Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, <span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is, <span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
That this night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon

All I can say is, <span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
<span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>
The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is, <span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
That this night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
<span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon
<span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
<span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
'Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, <span class="karaoke word1">I</span> <span class="karaoke word2">was</span> <span class="karaoke word3">en</span> <span class="karaoke word4">chant</span> <span class="karaoke word5">ed</span> <span class="karaoke word6">to</span> <span class="karaoke word7">meet</span> <span class="karaoke word8">you</span>
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
